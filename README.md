# FullStack3
The project involves creating an end-to-end simulation of a client-server system for a specific application. The client side is a Single Page Application (SPA) with multiple pages allowing users to access and modify information stored on the server. Possible applications include contact management, to-do lists, or meeting scheduling. Users can register, log in, and manage their data. The server side handles client requests, interacts with a simulated local database (using arrays or objects stored in local storage), and performs operations like data retrieval, addition, modification, and deletion. Communication between client and server is simulated using AJAX-like requests and JSON formatting. The project emphasizes modularity, clear separation of concerns, and proper documentation. It is developed collaboratively by pairs, ensuring equal participation in all components and technologies.
